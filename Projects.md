## Agricultural Robotics

| ![](/agrobotics.jpg) |  I was part of the Agricultural Robotics team at Georgia Insitute of Technology. The goal of the project is to detect prune points in trees using computer vision, and feed it as a input to the robot that can cut branches. To dectect such prune points, stimulated tree models with a variety of textures were created using blender python scripts, and these along with real tree images was used to train a Generative Adversarial Network. The accuracy of the pipeline was 93%.  <br><br> Check out the [project on github](https://github.com/JYChuah01/VIP) <br><br> Skills: Python, Computer Vision, Blender|
